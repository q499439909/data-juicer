    Key decisions:
    - executor_type is set to 'ray' so the job runs distributed on the
      cluster AND Ray is guaranteed to be initialized: RayExecutor.__init__
      calls initialize_ray(force=True), which lets both plain CPU ops
      (parallelized via Ray Data) and ray-native ops (e.g.
      ray_image_deduplicator, which needs ray.init()) run correctly.
      Inside a `ray job submit` job, ray.init(address="auto") attaches to
      the existing cluster; it does NOT use the blocked Ray Client port
      10001. Note: in ray mode the exporter treats export_path as a
      directory of shard files rather than a single file.
    - work_dir is forced to a Worker-local path (/tmp/...) keyed by the
      per-submission exec_id, so concurrent or repeated runs of the same
      plan never share logs/checkpoints. Otherwise
      data-juicer defaults it to os.path.dirname(export_path); when
      export_path is on an OSS FUSE mount, loguru's gz log compression
      calls os.remove() on the mount at shutdown, which the mount rejects
      (PermissionError -> job exits 1). Keeping logs/checkpoints/tmp on
      local disk avoids this; results still land at export_path.
    - Only emit fields known to be compatible with the Worker's older
